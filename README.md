# Advent Door

This is a small dedicated Project, that has the sole purpose to be made available to my girlfriend as part of an advent calendar I gave her in 2022. This means everything here is hardcoded and specific, but the door mechanic can be ripped and modified easily.

The door component is based on a reverse engineering of [Vuecember 2020](https://www.sumcumo.com/vuecember2020) by SUM.CUMO Sapiens
